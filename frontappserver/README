Project Structure:
    Main classes:
        /src/main/java/client - Sample client
        /src/main/java/server - CanvasServer is the entry point for the application.
    Test classes:
        /src/test/java/ - Unit tests

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two steps to run the frontend server.

1. Build Maven package and docker image (Note: Maven build can be optimized to use a local repository to cache jars)
    Step 1: Use base image to run first stage of the build using a desired version of Maven. This runs the unit tests
            and builds final package.

    Step 2: The second part of the file defines how the built jar is assembled into the final output image.

    Command to execute : docker build . -t frontappserver

2. Run application

    Command to execute : docker run --rm -it -p 8124:8124  frontappserver:latest
